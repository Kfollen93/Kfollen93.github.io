## Description
I created this website using the .NET Core (MVC) template from Visual Studio. I had experience utilizing the MVC structure before in my Ruby on Rails projects,
however I wanted to create this website using C# to better familiarize myself with the Microsoft realm of things. I spent a substantial amount of time reading about the .NET Framework and .NET Core in general, and then more specifically about Razor Pages and Blazor.

## Hosting
I knew I wanted to deploy to <b><a href=https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/> Azure</a></b> to get more experience within the Microsoft realm. Upon spending more time reading documentation, I found deployment to be surprisingly easy. I was able to use the Free Tier(F1) as an App Service, and I had the website up and running in a matter of minutes!
